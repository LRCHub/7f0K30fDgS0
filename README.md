```lrc
[00:02.40] On Cracker Island, it was born
[00:06.42] To the collective of the dawn
[00:10.82] They were planting seeds at night
[00:14.35] To grow a made-up paradise
[00:18.53] Where the truth was auto-tuned (forever cult)
[00:22.86] But it's sadness I consumed (forever cult)
[00:26.40] Into my formats every day (forever cult)
[00:30.49] In the end, I had to pay (what world is this?)
[00:34.75] In the end, I had to pay (I purged my soul)
[00:38.78] In the end, I had to pay (I drank to riot)
[00:43.19] Nothing more to say (I drank to riot)
[01:01.69] 
[00:46.45] They taught themselves to be occult
[00:50.54] They didn't know its many strategies
[00:54.44] They taught themselves to be occult
[00:58.44] They didn't know its many strategies (fantasies)
[01:22.44] 
[01:04.54] What world is this?
[01:08.48] What world is this?
[01:17.98] 
[01:10.45] On Cracker Island, it was raised
[01:14.42] By the collective from the grave
[01:18.67] It only came out at night
[01:22.62] It ate up their paradise (paradise)
[01:26.72] Where the truth was auto-tuned (forever cult)
[01:30.64] And it's sadness I consumed (forever cult)
[01:34.56] Into my formats every day (forever cult)
[01:38.77] In the end, I had to pay (what world is this?)
[01:42.69] Out there on my silver lake (I was not there)
[01:46.88] In the end, it will be great (beneath the hills)
[01:50.52] I'm like a ship between the tide (I saw myself)
[01:54.62] I held on to my surprise (there in the void)
[02:16.62] 
[01:58.58] They taught themselves to be occult
[02:02.58] They didn't know its many strategies
[02:06.50] They taught themselves to be occult
[02:10.30] They didn't know its many strategies (fantasy)
[02:33.30] 
[02:22.56] On Cracker Island, it will die (forever cult)
[02:26.53] Join the collective in the sky (forever cult)
[02:30.46] And on the shining bolt of light (forever cult)
[02:34.92] Go up to paradise (what world is this?)
[02:38.65] Where the truth is auto-tuned (I purged my soul)
[02:42.65] And it's sadness I consume (I drank to riot)
[02:46.58] Into my formats every day (I drank to riot)
[02:50.77] In the end, I had to pay (forever cult)
[02:54.66] In the end, I had to pay (forever cult)
[02:58.67] In the end, I'll be okay (forever cult)
[03:18.17] 
[03:03.16] Nothing more to say
[03:07.12] Nothing more to say
[03:11.11] Nothing more to say
